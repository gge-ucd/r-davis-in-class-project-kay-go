#NOTES 10/14/2021

#1. keep only observations before 1995
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")
surveys_base <- filter(surveys,year < 1995)
#don't even need to add the $ because it knows where year is already!
#2. keep year, sex, weight
surveys_base <- select(surveys_base,year,sex,weight)
str(surveys_base)
#3. Try going from 1 to 2 without the intermediate step?
surveys_base <- select(filter(surveys,year<1995),year,sex,weight)
str(surveys_base)
#can also pipe: surveys_base <- filter(surveys, year<1995) %>% select(year,sex,weight)
#can also pipe: surveys_base <- surveys %>% filter(year<1995) %>% select(year,sex,weight)
#can also nest: surveys_base <- filter(select(surveys,year,sex,weight),year<1995)
#4. Mutate function! Tidyverse's way of making a new column or changing the values of an existing column. Next task: Create a new data frame from the surveys data that meets the following criteria: (a) contains only the species_id column (b) and a new column called hindfoot_half containing values that are half the hindfoot_length values. (c) In this hindfoot_half column, there are no NAs and all values are less than 30. Name this data frame surveys_hindfoot_half.
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")
surveys
surveys_hindfoot_half <- surveys %>% filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>% mutate(hindfoot_half = hindfoot_length/2) %>% select(species_id, hindfoot_half) %>% filter(hindfoot_half < 30) %>% head()
surveys_hindfoot_half
#note the language tidyverse uses to do each of these steps; to visualize piping, can add in a ., before each stage.
#groupby and summarize, dataframes have subgroups
#Use group_by() and summarize() to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot length
#for each species (using species_id).
surveys
#hindfoot_metrics <- surveys %>% group_by(species_id) %>% summarize(max_hindfoot = max(hindfoot_length, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% summarize(min_hindfoot = min(hindfoot_length, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% summarize(mean_hindfoot = mean(hindfoot_length, na.rm = TRUE))
hindfoot_metrics
#can't run the above because piping eliminates groups of numbers that you'd want to be using for the next pipe. be cognizant of the numbers you're putting into the next dataframe.
#elegant way of doing this:
surveys_hindfoot_half %>% group_by(species_id) %>%
  mutate(hindfoot_length = hindfoot_half * 2) %>%
  summarize(avg_length = mean(hindfoot_length),min(hindfoot_length),max(hindfoot_length)) %>%
  head()
#mutate.if function will allow you to mutate if numeric, etc.

#command + shift + m creates pipe
#really wide or really long tables sometimes not visualized well by tbbls, can just use the review command

#Conditional Statements, e.g. is it larger or smaller than the mean value?
library(tidyverse)
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")
surveys %>% filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% mutate(weight_cat = case_when(weight > mean(weight) ~ "big", weight < mean(weight) ~ "small")) %>% select(weight, weight_cat) %>% tail()
#if(){this}else{thenthis}
# - represents "then"
#less clunky than ifelse when there are multiple layers

#Conditional Statements challenge
data(iris)
summary(iris$Petal.Length)
str(iris)
is.na(iris)
str(summary(iris$Petal.Length))

iris %>% mutate(petal.length_cat = case_when(Petal.Length < summary(iris$Petal.Length)[2] ~ "small", Petal.Length > summary(iris$Petal.Length)[2] & Petal.Length < summary(iris$Petal.Length)[5] ~ "medium", Petal.Length > summary(iris$Petal.Length)[5] ~ "large"))
#wooh! watch out for your caseUNDERSCOREwhen

#other way to do this?
iris %>% mutate(length_cat = ifelse(Peta.Length <- 1.6, "small", ifelse(Petal.Length) >= 5.1, "large", "medium"))
#if first statement is true, small, then go to nested. if nest is true, go to large and if still not true, go to medium.

#Using the iris data frame (this is built in to R), create a new variable that categorizes petal length into three groups:

#small (less than or equal to the 1st quartile)
#medium (between the 1st and 3rd quartiles)
#large (greater than or equal to the 3rd quartile)

#Hint: Explore the iris data using summary(iris$Petal.Length), to see the petal length distribution. Then use your function of choice: ifelse() or case_when() to make a new variable named petal.length.cat based on the conditions listed above. Note that in the iris data frame there are no NAs, so we donâ€™t have to deal with them here.

#Join function. Taking two dataframes and comparing them. #Columns in common, compares. Finds match? Performs function.

#Use what you just learned to create a scatter plot of weight and species_id with weight on the Y-axis, and species_id on the X-axis.

#challenge#2
#In many types of data, it is important to consider the scale of the observations. For example, it may be worth changing the scale of the axis to better distribute the observations in the space of the plot. 
#Changing the scale of the axes is done similarly to adding/modifying other components (i.e., by incrementally adding commands). Try making these modifications:
#Represent weight on the log10 scale; see scale_y_log10().
#Make a new plot to explore the distrubtion of hindfoot_length just for species NL and PF. 
#Overlay a jitter plot of the hindfoot lengths of each species by a boxplot. Then, color the datapoints according to the plot from which the sample was taken.
#Hint: Check the class for plot_id. Consider changing the class of plot_id from integer to factor. Why does this change how R makes the graph? geom_jitter()

#Boxplots are useful summaries, but hide the shape of the distribution. For example, if the distribution is bimodal, we would not see it in a boxplot. An alternative to the boxplot is the violin plot, where the shape (of the density of points) is drawn.
#Replace the box plot with a violin plot; see geom_violin().
surveys_plot <- ggplot(data = surveys, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5, aes(color=plot_type)) + theme_bw() + geom_violin(alpha = 1) + scale_y_log10()

surveys_plot2 <- filter(surveys, species_id == "NL" | species_id == "PF")
#why or instead of and? Or, because there isn't a single cell that has both values.
head(surveys_plot2)
ggplot(data = surveys_plot2, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = hindfoot_length))+ geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, aes(color = plot_id)) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 1)
#plot_id is numeric but we want it to be categorical!
hindfoot_survey <- surveys_plot2 %>% filter(species_id == "NL" | species_id == "PF")
hindfoot_survey$plot_factor <- as.factor(hindfoot_survey$plot_id)
#plots as factors have discrete levels 1 through 24
